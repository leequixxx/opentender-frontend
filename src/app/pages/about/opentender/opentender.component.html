				<p class="about__text" i18n>Around one-third of government expenditure is spent globally every year on procuring goods, works and services. Some estimates indicate that corruption increases the cost of government contracts by 20-25%. Corruption in public procurement also compromises widely supported public goals, such as building safe roads, high quality school buildings, or delivering medicine in time.</p>
				<p class="about__text" i18n>Providing comprehensive public procurement information free of charge in an easy-to-use format to all interested parties is expected to increase market transparency, decrease transaction costs, and facilitate government accountability. Hence, opentender.eu, a central, public, and open procurement platform has been set up to contribute to achieving value for money in public procurement as well as increasing integrity throughout the public sector.</p>

The Institute is a non-partisan think tank independent of governments, political parties or special interest groups. The aim of the Institute is to systematically explore the causes, characteristics, and consequences of low quality of government in an inter-disciplinary approach drawing on political science, economics, law, and data science. The Institute aims to aid citizens to hold governments accountable through the publication of large datasets and robust analysis.</p>
